Github pages has been available for a long time but I was reluctant to use it or more even use it as a blogging platform given the
plethora of blogging platforms available. However I found that most of the time I just need a very basic blogging platform but will
still give me the ability to insert whatever HTML or JS code that I wan't when I needed.

Since I also found myself using Gists more often to takedown note, I decided to take Github Pages and Jekyll a try today!
