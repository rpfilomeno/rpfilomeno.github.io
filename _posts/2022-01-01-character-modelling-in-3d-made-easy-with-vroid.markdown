Recently ive been dabbing into 3D modeling!

<!--break-->

I found out about [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) which allows you to create humanoid models (anime-style) including clothes and accessories. 



Here are some published models I made based on The Philippine Simulator's VTuber Tapsi and Lomi, you can view the models at [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/en/characters/2056041647174037182).



The Vroid models can easily be exported to VRM format then animated as dance performances using [MikuMikiDance](https://learnmmd.com/).

I was also able to easily import the models into Unity to make an 3rd Person RPG game using [UniVRM](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM) and [Starter Assets - Third Person Character Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526?aid=1011liAjm).
