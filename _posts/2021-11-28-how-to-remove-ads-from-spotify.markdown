Ive been using Spotify for a long time and I decided its about time to remove the ads that has been tracking my usage. 

<!--break-->

The ads on web player version is easily removed via browser plugins like uBlock Origin but i wanted to remove ads on the Spotify desktop and mobile apps.

First for the Spotify desktop app just download and install [EZ-Blocker](https://www.ericzhang.me/projects/spotify-ad-blocker-ezblocker/) by Xeroday, this comes in a single executable format without the need to install. Make sure to run this as administrator if you want to block ad banners too.

Finally for Spotify android app install via F-Droid app store the [Ad-Free AdBlocker for Spotify](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.abertschi.adfree/).

Both these applications does not break TOS or modify the application itself but mutes Spotify when playing advertisements.
