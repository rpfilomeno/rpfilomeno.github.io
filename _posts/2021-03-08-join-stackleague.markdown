There's a new local all year round competition for developers launching this March at https://stackleague.com

The price pool is 200,000 pesos (Php) as the time of this post.

I have created a repository of solutions at https://github.com/rpfilomeno/stacksleague so you may check techniques on how to easily setup your environment for the challenge.
